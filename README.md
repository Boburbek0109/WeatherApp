## About the Project

This project was built as a learning project to practice real iOS app development with SwiftUI, MVVM architecture, networking, JSON decoding, CoreLocation, and local persistence with SwiftData.
The main goal was not only to build a weather UI, but also to understand how different parts of an iOS application work together:

- requesting the user's current location
- fetching real weather data from an API
- decoding JSON responses into Swift models
- separating UI, business logic, and networking
- saving the selected city locally
- building reusable SwiftUI components

## Features

- Current weather by user location
- Weather forecast from OpenWeather API
- Hourly forecast cards
- Forecast screen with tomorrow and upcoming days
- City selection from a local JSON file
- Saved selected city using SwiftData
- Swipeable weather summary carousel
- Glass-style SwiftUI interface
- Pull-to-refresh support

## Tech Stack

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- MVVM
- async/await
- URLSession
- CoreLocation
- SwiftData
- JSONDecoder

## Setup

1. Get a free API key from OpenWeather.
2. Create `WeatherApp/Models/Secrets/Secrets.swift`.
3. Add:
```swift
enum Secrets {
    static let openWeatherApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```
4. Build and run the project in Xcode.
